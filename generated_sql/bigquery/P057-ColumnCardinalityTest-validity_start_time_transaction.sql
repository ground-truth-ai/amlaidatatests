-- Tests: transaction.validity_start_time
-- Severity: WARN
-- Description: An entity has more than 500 validity_start_time changes.
-- Interpretation: When count > 0, you should verify the number of changes to an entity being passed to the API is correct. Why are there so many changes for these entities?
