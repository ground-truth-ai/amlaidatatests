Backends
========

amlaidatatests uses `ibis <https://ibis-project.org/>`_ to define the transformations
it uses to define datatests. Ibis supports a range of available backends.

In future, it may be possible to test AML AI data for integrity before it is loaded into
bigquery.

Supported backends are listed below.
