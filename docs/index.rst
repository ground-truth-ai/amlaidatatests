AML AI Datatests documentation
==============================


Introduction
============

This utility tests data for consistency and data integrity in the format of the
`Google Anti Money Laundering AI API <https://cloud.google.com/financial-services/anti-money-laundering/docs>`_.

It aims to:
 * Validate the schema in which the data is being stored. For example, mandatory fields should be stored in
   non-nullable fields to make the most of the database's in-built validation capabilities.
 * Validate the data stored in the schema.


amlaidatatests is based on two main libraries:
* `Ibis Project <https://ibis-project.org/>`_.
* `Ibis Project <https://ibis-project.org/>`_.
