Design
------

amlaidatatests is based on two main libraries:
 * `Ibis Project <https://ibis-project.org/>`_ - which provides the ability to
   test the data in multiple databases. Only bigquery is supported at this time.
 * `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html/>`_ - which allows
   the use of multiple common python testing plugins.
